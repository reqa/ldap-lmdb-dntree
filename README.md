## Synopsis

dntree is an example implementation that shows how LDAP DNs can be stored in an [lmdb](http://lmdb.tech/doc/) database, structured as a hierarchical adjecency list.

## Code Example

An example showing how dntree can be used is given in `dntree-example1.c`.

## Motivation

I was curious to learn how to use lmdb. At univention we use the back-mdb backend, which is very reliable and performant.
So lmdb seems like a good choice for LDAP DN related stuff. But lmdb limits key size to 511 bytes by default. So, to
use lmdb in some contexts dealing with LDAP DNs (or file paths for that matter) it is useful to map DN values to ID keys
and vice versa.

## API Reference

The API, as defined by `dntree.h` is bound to change as this experiment continues.

## Tests

```
make
./dntree-example1 -d 3
```
